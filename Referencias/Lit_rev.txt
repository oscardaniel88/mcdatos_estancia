* Ideas
** Indeed, expectations of revenue gains that are possible with expanded revenue management capabilities are now driving the acquisition of new IT.
** Four key areas : -Forecasting, overbooking, seat inventory control, and pricing.
** Airlines have the longest history of development in revenue management.
** More detailed accounts of the origins of revenue management can be found in BELOBABA (1987a), SMITH, LEIMKUHLER, and DARROW (1992), CROSS (1995), DUNLEAVY (1995), and VINOD (1995).

* Forecasting for Hotel Revenue Management: Testing Aggregation Against Disaggregation

* Abstract: A successful yield-management strategy is predicated on effective control of customer demand.
  Businesses have two interrelated strategic levers with which to accomplish this, namely, pricing and duration of customer use.
  Prices can be fixed or variable and duration can be predictable or unpredictable.
  Variable pricing to control demand is conceptually a straightforward process.
  It can take the form of discount prices at off-peak hours for all customers or it can be in the form of price discounts for certain classes of customers.
* Ideas
** Industries traditionally associated with revenue management (hotel, airline, rental car, and cruise line) tend to use variable pricing for services with a specified or predictable duration.
** Predicting Customer Arrivals
   Successful revenue-management applications are generally found in industries where managers can make a reasonable prediction regarding customers’ duration of use (Quadrant 2)
   Forecasting is key. Accurate forecasting is one of the ways to increase the predictability of duration of use.
   Forecast accuracy has a significant effect on revenue generated from revenue-management systems. In his study of airline forecasting, Lee found that a 10-percent improvement in forecast accuracy on high-demand flights resulted in an increase in revenue of 1.5 to 3.0 percent.
   Finding the best approach. Most major hotel chains use linear-programming-based models that require detailed forecasts by day of arrival, length of stay, and rate category
   Previous research has shown that exponential smoothing and the classical-pickup method pro- duce the most accurate forecasts of six methods that were tested
** Forecast Aggregation and Disaggregation
   The data showed the volatility typical in the hotel industry
   This volatility makes it extremely difficult to achieve accurate forecasts, and may cause the random-walk forecast to outperform other fore- casting methods.

* Dynamic room pricing model for hotel revenue management systems
* Author: Heba Abdel Aziz a, Mohamed Saleh a,*, Mohamed H. Rasmy a, Hisham ElShishiny b
* El Cairo University
* Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of room pricing in hotels.
  We propose a hotel revenue management model based on dynamic pricing to provide hotel managers with a flexible and efficient decision support tool for room revenue maximization.
  The two pillars of the proposed framework are a novel optimization model, and a multi-class scheme similar to the one implemented in airlines.
  Our hypothesis is that this framework can overcome the limitations associated with the research gaps in pricing literature;
  and can also contribute significantly in increasing the revenue of hotels. We test this hypothesis on three different approaches,
  and the results show an increase in revenue compared to the classical model used in literature.
* Ideas
** Revenue management is commonly practiced in the hotel industry to help hotels decide on room rate and allocation.
** Hotel revenue management is perceived as a managerial tool for attempting to sell each room with the highest price so as to achieve the highest revenue
** A revenue management system applies basic economic prin- ciples to pricing and controlling rooms’ inventory. In fact there are three basic categories of demand-management decisions that are addressed by revenue management in general
  – Structural decisions: Decide which selling format to use; which segmentation or differentiation mechanisms to use; which terms to trade to offer.
  – Price decisions: Decide on how to set posted prices, individ- ual-offer prices, and reserve prices; how to price across product categories; how to price over time; how to discount over the product lifetime.
  – Quantity decisions: Decide whether to accept or reject an offer to buy; how to allocate capacity to different segments; when to withhold a product from the market and sale at later points in time.
** Traditionally hotels use the capacity controls/quantity deci- sions as a default tactic, this is due to its simplicity as the different products a hotel offers are all supplied using the same, homogeneous hotel capacity.
** Our main assumption is that using price decisions in hotel revenue management systems will signif- icantly increase the revenue of the hotel
** Price is not only important from a financial point of view, but also from an operational standpoint. It is a tool that helps to regulate inventory and production pressures.
** Previous work on dynamic pricing use a predetermined dis- crete set of prices from which they optimally allocate the price for a given night, since using a continuous set of prices would add to the complexity of the model and will need a sophisticated large-scale programming solver to obtain the optimal solution
** For example, to calibrate the value of elasticity in the third approach we implemented the following algorithm:
  – Loop for different values of the elasticity ‘e’.
    Begin loop For Cl=Lowest capacity: Highest capacity.
􏰂      Solve the optimization model given ‘Cl’ and ‘e’.
􏰂      Plot the graph of optimized prices along the simulated
    End loop.
    Compare all plotted prices (for a given e) with the price range extracted from the actual data in Plaza hotel.
  – End Loop.

* A Comparison of Forecasting Methods for Hotel Revenue Management
* Cita: Weatherford, L. R., & Kimes, S. E. (2003). A comparison of forecasting methods for hotel revenue management [Electronic version]. Retrieved [2018/09], from Cornell University, School of Hotel Administration site: http://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/articles/753
* Abstract: The arrivals forecast is one of the key inputs for a successful hotel revenue management system, but no research on the best forecasting method has been conducted.
  In this research, we used data from Choice Hotels and Marriott Hotels to test a variety of forecasting methods and to determine the most accurate method
  Preliminary results using the Choice Hotel data show that pickup methods and regression produced the lowest error, while the booking curve and combination forecasts produced fairly inaccurate results.
  The more in-depth study using the Marriott Hotel data showed that exponential smoothing, pickup, and moving average models were the most robust.
** Lee (1990) found that a 10% increase in forecast accuracy in the airline industry increased revenue by 0.5-3.0% on high demand flights
** The data that is used for hotel forecasting has two dimensions to it: when the reservation was booked and when the room was consumed. The booking information gives the manager additional detail which can be used to update the forecast. Without this information, the manager would have to rely solely on the historical information on the daily number of arrivals or rooms sold.
** Revenue management forecasting methods fall into one of three types (Lee, 1990): historical booking models, advanced booking models and combined models
** Historical booking models only consider the final number of rooms or arrivals on a particular stay night
** Advanced booking models only include the build-up of reservations over time for a particular stay night.
** Combined models use either regression or a weighted average of historical and advanced booking models to develop forecasts.
** Most published research on revenue management forecasting is primarily based on the airline industry (e.g., L’Heureux, 1986; Lee, 1990; Wickham, 1995), while unpublished research covers a variety of industries but is considered proprietary in nature.

** Wickham (1995) presented a simple linear regression method in which the independent variable was the number of reservations on hand for a flight at a particular reading day and the dependent variable was the final number of seats sold. Skwarek (1996), Weatherford (1997) and Zickus (1998) have presented a similar approach.
** Wickham (1995) studied the accuracy of a variety of forecasting methods for a set of airline data. He studied both (a) historical forecasting methods (simple averages and weighted averages) and (b) pickup- based forecasting methods (classical and advanced pickup methods) and found that in general, pickup- based forecasting methods provided the most accurate forecasts of the two groups he studied.
** Weatherford (1998) compared additive methods, multiplicative methods, and regression in an airline context and found that additive methods and regression out-performed multiplicative methods.
** Zickus (1998) found that the choice of unconstraining method, combined with the choice of forecasting method and optimization method impacted revenue produced.
** Managers must also consider what to forecast (arrivals or room nights), the level of aggregation (total, by rate category (RC), by length of stay (LOS), or some combination), the type of data (constrained or unconstrained), the number of periods to include in the forecast, which data to use, outliers and the measurement of accuracy
** Although most hotels rely on room night forecasts (1B), most sophisticated revenue management systems rely on arrivals- based forecasts (1A).
*+ Arrivals- based forecasts are more appropriate for revenue management because the types of rate and availability controls usually imposed are applied to guests arriving on a particular night.
** Along with the arrivals-based forecast comes the question of the appropriate level of aggregation. Most sophisticated revenue management systems rely on detailed arrivals forecasts. Information is commonly available by rate category, length of stay, and in some cases, room type
** Historical room sales are constrained by the capacity of the hotel and by the booking limits placed on various rate categories and lengths of stay.
** Lee (1990) and Wickham (1995) tested the impact of truncated and censored data on the accuracy of the forecast and found that forecasts made with unconstrained data were more accurate.
** The classical pickup method (L’Heureux, 1986) uses booking data for only completed stay nights (5A) while the advanced pickup method (L’Heureux, 1986) uses all booking data, even from incomplete stay nights (5B).
** In terms of the forecasting typology presented in Table 2, the Choice Hotels data used were arrivals- based (1A), were aggregated across all rate categories and lengths of stay (2A) and had been unconstrained using a booking curve approach (3C2). Forecasts were developed using a select number of periods that varied from 1 to 12 (4B) and for most of the forecasting methods, only completed stay nights were used (5A
** Advanced pick-up and regression methods outperformed multiplicative methods for all four hotels (see Fig. 1 for a typical graph).

* A Machine Learning Model for Occupancy Rates and Demand Forecasting in the Hospitality Industry
* Authors: William Caicedo-Torres and Fabi ́an Payares
* Universidad Tecnoloógica de Bolıvar
* Abstract: Occupancy rate forecasting is a very important step in the decision-making process of hotel planners and managers.
  Popular strate- gies as Revenue Management feature forecasting as a vital activity for dynamic pricing, and without accurate forecasting,
  errors in pricing will negatively impact hotel financial performance. However, having accurate enough forecasts is no simple task for a wealth of reasons,
  as the inherent variability of the market, lack of personnel with statistical skills, and the high cost of specialized software. In this paper,
  several machine learning techniques were surveyed in order to construct models to forecast daily occupancy rates for a hotel,
  given historical records of bookings and occupation. Several approaches related to dataset construction and model validation are discussed.
  The results obtained in terms of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are promising, and support the use of machine learning models as a tool to
  help solve the problem of occupancy rates and demand forecasting.
* Ideas
** The discipline of Revenue Management, which allows selling each room at the highest price customers are willing to pay, so the highest income can be achieved
** In Revenue Management, forecasting is the essential element in pricing
** Basically, approaches to occupation forecasting can be grouped in two cat- egories: historical booking models and advanced booking models
** Historical booking models try to solve the forecasting problem as a time series modelling problem, and advanced booking problems use reservations data, and the concept of ”Pick-Up”, which is the increment of bookings N from now to a day T (for which there are already K reservations) in the future, resulting in an occupation forecast of K + N for day T
** We propose the use of Machine Learning algorithms to build predictive models for the occupancy rates and demand in the hospitality industry, that can be readily used by hotel personnel, without advanced training in statistics
** Ridge Regression [9] is a regression algorithm that includes a complexity penalty (called a regularization term) in its cost function in order to better approximate the out-of-sample error. Ridge Regression penalizes the the algorithm by a factor proportional to the Euclidean (L2) norm of its parameter vector,
** Kernel Ridge Regression [12] is a Kernel Method that projects the original data to a feature space, without explicitly computing the transformations, via the Kernel Trick [
** The Multilayer Perceptron [15] is a feed forward neural network model capable of classification and regression
** Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks [5] are Neural Networks with usually one hidden layer, that employ a set of functions called Radial Basis Functions as feature detectors. RBF nets can be used to perform regression and classification as well. Each neuron in the hidden layer uses a a RBF as activation function φ, with the Gaussian function
** model performance is measured through Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), defined as average of (real - predicted )/ real
** We used the Mlpy Python library [2] implementation of Ridge Regression and Kernel Ridge Regression, the ALGLIB library [4] implementation of Multilayer Perceptron and Thomas Ru ̈ckstieß Radial Basis Function Networks implemen- tation
** Different mod- els were trained and validated using Ridge Regression, Kernel Ridge Regression, Multilayer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function Networks.
** The results obtained are promising and support the use of black-box Machine Learning based tools for estimating hotel occupation, which require little statistical expertise by the hotel staff

* AN INTEGRATED FORECASTING APPROACH FOR HOTELS
* Authors: Sedat Yüksel
* ISAHP 2005, Honolulu, Hawaii, July 8-10, 2005
* Abstract: It was aimed to search to be able to forecast the crises which arise from demand fluctuations, and to able to generate a systematic and dynamic
  process in the hotel businesses. In the quantitative period, forecasting was realized to 149 monthly series of a five star hotel in Ankara via MA, Simple,
  Holt's, Winter's Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA.
  The results of these methods were compared by some error measures. At the other side of integration, two Delphi based inquiry panels were realized:
  The Variables Determination Panel and The Environmental Monitoring Panel. The opinions of second group panelists were used to adjust Winter's Multiplicative
  forecasts via AHP based approach.

* A taxonomy of demand uncensoring methods in revenue management
* Authors: Shadi Sharif Azadeha, Patrice Marcotteb and Gilles Savarda
* Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Canada; and bUniversity of Montreal, Montreal, Canada
* Abstract: Revenue management systems rely on customer data, and are thus affected by the absence of registered demand that arises when a product is no longer available.
  In the present work, we review the uncensoring (or unconstraining) techniques that have been proposed to deal with this issue, and develop a taxonomy based on their respective
  features. This study will be helpful in identifying the relative merits of these techniques, as well as avenues for future research.
* Ideas:
** According to Weatherford and Belobaba (2002), underestimating demand by 12.5–25 per cent can result in a loss of revenue from 1 per cent to 3 per cent, which is significant
** Advanced booking models (including pickup, advanced pickup, booking profile) are based on registered bookings over time, and can be of the additive or multiplicative type
** Classical or advanced pickups are additive models that differ in their treatment of historical data (Lee, 1990; Wickham, 1995).

* Forecasting Destination Weekly Hotel Occupancy with Big Data
* Cita: Pan, B. & Yang, Y. (2017). Forecasting destination weekly hotel occupancy with big data, Journal of Travel Research, In Press.
* Abstract: Accurate forecasting of future performance of hotels is needed so hospitality constituencies in specific destinations can benchmark their properties and better optimize operations
  As competition increases, hotel managers have urgent need for accurate short-term forecasts.
  In this study, time series models including several tourism big data sources, including search engine queries, website traffic and weekly weather information, are tested in order to construct an accurate forecasting model of weekly hotel occupancy for a destination
  The results show the superiority of ARMAX models with both search engine queries and website traffic data in accurate forecasting.
  Also, the results suggest that weekly dummies are superior to Fourier terms in capturing the hotel seasonality
  The limitations of the inclusion of multiple big data sources are noted since the reduction in forecasting error is minimal
* Ideas
** Increased competition and the adoption of revenue management practices have driven demand for accurate forecasting to maximize profits and optimize operations in the hotel industry (Schwartz and Hiemstra 1997).
** Traditional forecasting methods include time series analysis, statistical methods, neural networks, pickup methods, and simulation (Law 1998, Song and Li 2008).
** In this study, we adopt two methods to capture the seasonality of a destination’s weekly hotel occupancy.
** we use two different models (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with External Variables and a Markov switching dynamic regression model) to predict weekly hotel occupancy for one destination, both with and without big data

* Dynamic Pricing for Hotel Revenue Management Using Price Multipliers
* Authors: Abd El-Moniem Bayoumi, Mohamed Saleh, Amir Atiya, Heba Abdel Aziz, Amir Atiya
* Abstract: In this paper we propose a new dynamic pricing approach for the hotel revenue management problem.
  The proposed approach is based on having “price multipliers” that vary around “1” and provide a varying discount premium over some seasonal reference price.
  The price multipliers are a function of certain influencing variables.
  We apply an optimization algorithm for determining the parameters of these multipliers, the goal being to maximize the revenue, taking into account current demand, and the demand-price sensitivity of the hotel’s guest.
  The optimization algorithm makes use of a Monte Carlo simulator that simulates all the hotel’s processes, such as reservations arrivals, cancellations, duration of stay, no shows, group reservations, seasonality, trend, etc, as faithfully as possible.
  We have tested the proposed approach by successfully applying it to the revenue management problem of Plaza Hotel, Alexandria, Egypt, as a case study.
* Ideas
** Hotel revenue systems can be partitioned into two major groups: Quantity control approach and dynamic pricing approach
** Each multiplier will adjust the price up or down around the reference price based on a certain influencing variables
** The proposed dynamic pricing model has the advantage of framing the price in terms of carefully optimized premiums and discounts over a time varying or seasonal reference price set by the hotel.
** Feng and Xiao (2000) present a dynamic pricing model, where prices are selected from a set of predetermined prices over time
** Zhao and Zheng (2000) present a dynamic pricing model for selling a stock of a perishable product, where the demand is stochastic and it follows a non-homogeneous Poisson process
** Gallego and Van Ryzin (1994) investigate the problem of pricing a perishable stock of items. They find an upper bound for general demand. Finally, they extend their results by modeling the demand as a compound Poisson process
** It is common in the literature to assume Poisson arrivals for the product demand.
** A hotel room reservation typically covers a number of days, and this duration of stay effect has to be taken into account.
** We have four multipliers that represent the “control variables”. They will be multiplied by the reference price, to obtain the final price
**  Each of the four multipliers corresponds to a variable that is known to have an influencing effect on pricing decisions.
    1. Time from reservation till arrival date.
    2. The hotel’s remaining capacity at the time of the reservation.
    3. The length of stay, abbreviated as LoS.
    4. The number of rooms to be reserved (group size).
**  To simplify the problem formulation, these multipliers are usually taken as linear or piecewise linear functions of the influencing variables, whose levels and slope are determined by the optimization algorithm.
** For instance, if the remaining capacity is high, then the multiplier should be low in order to attract more customers using the lower price
** Conversely, if the remaining capacity is small, the hotel prices the rooms higher to better save the remaining few rooms for higher paying customers.
** Price = Seasonal Reference Price * Time multiplier * Capacity multiplier * Los Multiplier * Group Size multiplier
** The proposed model uses the concept of price multipliers that provide a varying discount/premium within some bands over some seasonal reference price.

* Forecasting hotel arrivals and occupancy using Monte Carlo simulation
* Athanasius Zakharya, Amir F. Atiyab, Hisham El-Shishinyc and Neamat E. Gayara
* Abstract: Forecasting hotel arrivals and occupancy is an important component in hotel revenue management systems.
  In this article, we propose a new Monte Carlo simulation approach for the arrivals and occupancy forecasting problem
  In this approach, we simulate the hotel reservations process forward in time,and these future Monte Carlo paths will yield forecast densities.
  A key step for the faithful emulation of the reservations process is the accurate estimation of its parameters.
  We propose an approach for the estimation of these parameters from the historical data.
  Then, the reservations process will be simulated forward with all its constituent processes such as reservation arrivals, cancellations, length of stay, no shows, group reservations, seasonality, trend and so on
* Ideas
** A key component of hotel room RM system is the forecasting of the daily hotel arrivals and occupancy.
** Inaccurate forecasts will signifi- cantly impact the performance of the RM system, because the forecast is the main driver of the pricing/room allocation decisions (see Lee (1990) and Weatherford and Kimes (2003)
** Developing an empirical formula that relates the value to be forecasted with the recent history (for example, ARIMA-type or exponential smoothing mod- els).
** The other approach focuses on developing a model from first principles that relates the value in question with the available variables/ parameters and so on, and simulates that model forward to obtain the forecast
** Basically, the approaches can be grouped into two cate- gories: time series models and reservations- based models.
** Time series models consider only the arrivals or the occupancy time series, and apply time series models (such as exponential smoothing, ARIMA and so on) on these.
** The reservations-based approach, on the other hand, makes use of the reservations data to forecast future arrivals. It typically utilizes the concept of ‘pick-up’. This means that given K reservations for a future day T, we expect to ‘pick-up’ N more reservations from now until T.
** The forecast will then be K + N
** There are two versions of the pick-up model (see Weatherford and Kimes, 2003). In the additive version, we add to the current number of reservations the average number of reser- vations typically picked up between the current date and the arrival date (of course, taking seasonality into account).
** The multiplicative pick-up model is similar except that we add a fraction of the current number of reserva- tions, rather than an amount independent of that number.
** In the first phase, we estimate all the parameters of the reservations process (only the in-sample data are used for this purpose).
*+ In the second phase, we simulate the reservations process forward in time to obtain the forecasts using the parameter estimates obtained in the first phase.
** A possible way to model reservations arrivals is to use a Poisson process. Because of the discrete nature of the way the data are recorded (that is, by days) this approach can lead to difficulties and rounding inaccuracies. So we opted for a different approach whereby we model the reservations arrivals as Bernoulli trials.

* Hotel revenue management – a critical literature review
* Stanislav Ivanov and Vladimir Zhechev
* Abstract: The paper presents a critical literature review of the main concepts of hotel revenue management (RM) and current state of theoretical research.
  It emphasizes on the different directions of hotel RM research and focuses comprehensively on the elements of the hotel RM system and the stages of RM process.
  Special attention is paid to the different hotel RM centres, the pricing and non-pricing RM tools, forecasting methods, the RM software, RM team and ethical considerations as they play a central role in the RM practice.
* Ideas
** The application of RM requires a lot of data regarding different RM metrics – average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), occupancy, yield, profit per available room, etc
** Non pricing tools: Capacity management, overbooking, Los control, channel Management
** Pricing tools: Price discrimination, dynamic Pricing

* ANALYZING THE USE OF AN ADVANCE BOOKING CURVE IN FORECASTING HOTEL RESERVATIONS
* Tony Sze Ming Tse Yiu Tung Poon
* Abstract: Although there is considerable interest in the advance bookings model as a forecasting method in the hotel industry, there has been little research analyzing the use of an advance booking curve in forecasting hotel reservations.
  The mainstream of advance booking models reviewed in the literature uses only the bookings-on-hand data on a certain day and ignores the previous booking data.
  This empirical study analyzes the entire booking data set for one year provided by the Hotel ICON in Hong Kong, and identifies the trends and patterns in the data.
  The analysis demonstrates the use of an advance booking curve in forecasting hotel reservations at property level.
* Ideas
** The seven forecast- ing methods are simple exponential smoothing; moving average methods; linear regression; logarithmic linear regression; additive method; multiplicative method; and Holt’s double expo- nential smoothing.
** regression produced the lowest error, while the booking curve and combination forecasts produced fairly inaccurate results.
** Rajopadhye, Ghalia, Wang, Baker, and Eister (2001), on the other hand, simulate the process of hotel reservation requests using a Poisson distribution to forecast occupancy
** In fact, the hotel industry believes that booking pickup is one of the most acc- urate prognosticators of future performance (Rubicon, 2010), and it has been reported that the average hotel reservation lead time is 36 days for leisure travel and 21 days for business travel
** Therefore it can be argued that the bookings-on-hand subsume all the factors affecting room occupancy, and such effects will carry through over the entire booking per- iod. If a booking trend based on the advance bookings-on-hand can be estimated or estab- lished, it could be a good indicator of final room occupancy.
** Linear regression methods assume that there is a correlation between the current number of reservations-on-hand (Day n) and the final number of reservations (Day 0): Forecast@Day 0 = a + b x bookings@Day n
** Logarithmic linear regression methods also assume a different relation between the current number of reservations-on- hand (Day n) and the final number of reservations (Day 0): Log (Forecast@Day 0) =  a + b x Log(bookings@Day n)
** The additive method adds the current book- ings to the average historical pickup in bookings from the reading day (Day n) to the actual night of the stay (Day 0): Forecast@Day 0 =  bookings@Day n + average pickup (Day n to Day 0)
** The multiplicative method multiplies the current bookings by the average historical pickup ratio in bookings from the reading day (Day n) to the actual night of the stay (Day 0): Forecast@Day 0 = bookings@Day n x average pickup ratio (Day n to Day 0)

* An Overview of Pricing Models for Revenue Management
* Gabriel Bitran, René Caldentey, (2003) An Overview of Pricing Models for Revenue Management. Manufacturing & Service Operations Management 5(3):203-229. https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.5.3.203.16031
* Abstract: In this paper, we examine the research and results of dynamic pricing policies and their relation to revenue management.
  The survey is based on a generic revenue management problem in which a perishable and nonrenewable set of resources satisfy stochastic price- sensitive demand processes over a finite period of time.
  In this class of problems, the owner (or the seller) of these resources uses them to produce and offer a menu of final products to the end customers.
  Within this context, we formulate the stochastic control problem of capacity that the seller faces: How to dynamically set the menu and the quantity of products and their corresponding prices to maximize the total revenue over the selling horizon.
* Ideas
** Price is one of the most effective variables that managers can manipulate to encourage or discourage demand in the short run.
** The costs associated with relabelling the prices of the products and informing customers about these changes have dropped significantly in the electronic environment when compared to traditional brick-and- mortar businesses (e.g., Brynjolfsson and Smith 1999)

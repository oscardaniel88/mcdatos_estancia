* Revenue Management: Research Overview and Prospects
* Author: Jeffrey I. McGill & Garrett J. Van Ryzin
* Año de publicación: 1999
* Transportation Science Vol. 33, No. 2, May 1999
* ISBN: 0041-1655/99//3302-0233
* Abstract: Forty-year History of research on transportation revenue management (also known as yield management).
  Covers development in forecasting, overbooking, seat inventory control and pricing, as they relate to revenue mngmnt,
  and suggest future research directions. The survey includes a glossary of revenue management terminology and a bib of 190 ref
* Ideas
** Indeed, expectations of revenue gains that are possible with expanded revenue management capabilities are now driving the acquisition of new IT.
** Four key areas : -Forecasting, overbooking, seat inventory control, and pricing.
** Airlines have the longest history of development in revenue management.
** More detailed accounts of the origins of revenue management can be found in BELOBABA (1987a), SMITH, LEIMKUHLER, and DARROW (1992), CROSS (1995), DUNLEAVY (1995), and VINOD (1995).
** The objective in revenue management is to maximize profits
** Revenue Management in Hospitality - Rothstein (1974), Ladany (1977), Liberman and Yechiali (1977, 1978), Kimes (1989), Bitran and
Mondschein (1995), Feng and Gallego (1995), Bitran and Gilbert (1996)
** BECKMANN and BOBKOWSKI (1958). In that paper, the authors compare Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Gamma models of total passenger arrivals
** The use of the Poisson process, when appropriate, is useful in dynamic treatments because of the memoryless property of the exponential interarrival distribution
** Data contained in historical booking records are censored by the presence of booking and capacity limits on past demands.
** Traditional regression techniques for aggregate airline forecasting are described in a book by TANEJA (1978).
** Sa (1987). Sa concludes that use of regres- sion techniques can improve the performance of revenue management systems when compared to time series analysis or historical averages.
** It is now common for airline practitioners to view pricing as part of the revenue management process.

* Forecasting for Hotel Revenue Management: Testing Aggregation Against Disaggregation
* Author: Lawrence R. Weatherford, Sheryl E. Kimes, Darren A. Scott
* CITA: Weatherford, L. R., Kimes, S. E., & Scott, D. A. (2001). Forecasting for hotel revenue management: Testing aggregation against disaggregation [Electronic version].

* Abstract: A successful yield-management strategy is predicated on effective control of customer demand.
  Businesses have two interrelated strategic levers with which to accomplish this, namely, pricing and duration of customer use.
  Prices can be fixed or variable and duration can be predictable or unpredictable.
  Variable pricing to control demand is conceptually a straightforward process.
  It can take the form of discount prices at off-peak hours for all customers or it can be in the form of price discounts for certain classes of customers.
* Ideas
** Industries traditionally associated with revenue management (hotel, airline, rental car, and cruise line) tend to use variable pricing for services with a specified or predictable duration.
** Predicting Customer Arrivals
   Successful revenue-management applications are generally found in industries where managers can make a reasonable prediction regarding customers’ duration of use (Quadrant 2)
   Forecasting is key. Accurate forecasting is one of the ways to increase the predictability of duration of use.
   Forecast accuracy has a significant effect on revenue generated from revenue-management systems. In his study of airline forecasting, Lee found that a 10-percent improvement in forecast accuracy on high-demand flights resulted in an increase in revenue of 1.5 to 3.0 percent.
   Finding the best approach. Most major hotel chains use linear-programming-based models that require detailed forecasts by day of arrival, length of stay, and rate category
   Previous research has shown that exponential smoothing and the classical-pickup method pro- duce the most accurate forecasts of six methods that were tested
** Forecast Aggregation and Disaggregation
   The data showed the volatility typical in the hotel industry
   This volatility makes it extremely difficult to achieve accurate forecasts, and may cause the random-walk forecast to outperform other fore- casting methods.
